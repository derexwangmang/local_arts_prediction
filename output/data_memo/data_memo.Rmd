## Overview

## Research Questions

Our project will be focused on a predictive analysis. Potential research questions
include:

- Based on some or all of the factors, how often would a given participant attend
different performances?
- Based on some or all of the factors, what is the age of the participant?
- Based on some or all of the factors, what is the income range for the participant?

Of these, predicting the income range is the most similar to a real world scenario.
Thus, we will most likely focus on answering that question. Since this is an income
range, rather than income itself, this question may be best answered by a classification
approach.

Variables that may be helpful in modeling the response may include the education
level, age, and participation in arts and performances.

## Expected Data Difficulties

The data retrieval process consisted of downloading the dataset from an online resource.

After briefly reviewing the dataset, the data appear to be organized and tidy.
Many rows contain `NA` values, but that is most likely due to the fact that some
values are conditional, dependent on the answers to other columns. For example,
the second column is about whether the participant attended a live jazz performance,
while third column is about how many times the participant attended a live jazz
performance in the last 12 months. There are 4188 `No` responses and 9 `Don't know`
responses in the second column and 4197 `NA` responses in the third column. Thus,
while some of the data appear to be missing, this may be because the interviewer
the question did not apply to the respondent, and the implicit value is 0. In
other cases, however, the data may be missing, or the participant felt uncomfortable
answering the question.
