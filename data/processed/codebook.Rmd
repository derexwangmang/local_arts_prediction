## Description

This is the main dataset used in this predictive modeling project. It contains data from the Local Area Arts Participation study in 1992, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts (Research Division) and conducted by Abt Associates of Cambridge, MA. There are 88 variables (note: through our pre-modeling analysis process, 22 variables were removed, and thus only 66 variables were used in the modeling process).
